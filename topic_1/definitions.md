Access Control List (ACL):

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP): Protocol used to map known IP addresses to unknown physical addresses

ARP Poisoning: An attack that convinces the network that the attacked MAC (Media Access Control) address is the one associated with an allowed address so that traffic is wrongly sent to the attacker's address

ARP Spoofing: Same as ARP Poisoning

adware: Software that gathers information to pass onto marketers or that interncepts personal data such as credit card numbers and makes it available to third parties.

antivirus software: Software that identifies the presences of a virus and is capable of removing or quarantining the virus

APT: Advanced persistent threat

armoured virus: A virus that is protected in a way that makes disassembling it tricky

attack: Any unauthorised intrusion into the normal operatiosn of a computer or computer network. The attack can be carried out to gain access to the system or any of its resources

attack surface: The area of an application that is available to users - those who are authenticated and, more importantly, those who are not

attack surface reduction (ASR): Minimising the possibility of exploitation by reducing the amount of code and limiting potential damage

backdoor: An opening left in a system or application that allows unexpected/additional access to data or resources. Typically these are created for debugging purposed and therefore not documented. These should be closed/removed before the application goes into production, otherwise they provide gaps/security loopholes

bot: An automated software program (network robot) that collects information on the web. In ÃŸits maliciou form, a bot is a compromised computer being controlled remotely

buffer overflow: A type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that occurs when more data is put in a buffer than it can hold, thereby overflowing it

clickjacking: Using multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a user into clicking a button/link.

companion virus: A virus that creates a new program that runs in the place of an expected program of the same name

cross-site request forgery (XSRF): A form of web-based attack in which unauthorised commands are sent from a user that the website trusts

cross-site scripting (XSS): Running a script routine on a user's machine from a website without their permission

denial-of-service (DoS): A type of attack that prevents any users from using a system

dictionary attack: The act of attempting to crack passwords by testing them against a list of dictionary words. Any password based on any dictionary word is vulnerable.

distributed denial-of-service: A derivative of a DoS attack where multiple hosts in multiple locations all focus on one target to reduce its availability to the public.

DNS Spoofing: The DNS server is givien information about a name server that it thinks is legitimate when it isn't

Domain Name System (DNS): The network service used in TCP/IP networks that translates hostnames to IP addresses

integer overflow: Putting too much information into too small a space that has been set aside for numbers

IP Spoofing: Making the data look like it came from a trusted host when it didn't

keylogger: a keylogger is a piece of software that records keystorkes pressed into a log file and then allows that logi file to be viewed so that passwords and other sensitive data can be seen

least privilege: A permissioning method that ensure users are granted only the privileges necessary to perform their job function

least privilege policy: The policy of giving a user only the minimum permissions needed to do the work that must be done

logic bomb: Any code that is hidden within an application and causes something unexpected to happen based on some criteria being met

macro virus: A software exploitation virus that works by using the macro feature included in many applications such as MS Office

malicious code: Any code that is meant to cause harm

malicious insider threat: A threat from someone inside the organisation intent on causing harm

man-in-the-middle: An attack that occurs when someone/something that is trusted intercepts packets and retransmits them to another party.

multipartite virus: A virus that attacks a system in more than one way.

password attacks: Attempting to ascertain a password that you shouldn't know

phage virus: A virus that modifies and alters other programs and databases

ping of death: A large Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packet sent to overflow the remote host's buffer, usually causing them to hang or reboot.

polymorphic: An attribute of some viruses that allows them to mutate and appear differently each time they're observed. This makes it harder for av tools to detect and react to these viruses

privilege escalation: The result of when a user obtains access to a resource they shouldn't normally have access to

ransomware: Software that demands payment before restoring the data or system infected

remote administrator tool (RAT): 

replay attack: An attack that captures portions of a session to play back later to convince a host that it is still talking to the original connection

retrovirus: A virus designed to attack or bypass the antivirus installed on the device

rogueware: A form of malware that tries to convince the user to pay for a fake threat

rootkit: Software program that can get root-level access and hide certain things from the OS

scareware: Software that tries to convince unsuspecting users that a threat exists

shim: A small library that is created to intercept API calls transparently

software exploitation: Attacks launched against applications and higher-level services

spoofing: An attempt by someone or something to masquerade as someone/something else

spyware: Software programs that work on behalf of a third party

stealth virus: A virus that attempts to avoid detection by masking itself from applications

Trojan horse: Any application the masquerades as one thing in order to get past scrutiny and then does something malicious.

typo squatting: Creating domains that are similar to those for a known entity but based on a mispelling or typographical error

URL hijacking: Registeting domains similar to those of a known entity but based on a mispelling or typographical error

virus: A program intended to couse damage on a computer system

watering hole attack: Identifying a site visited by the target victim, poisoning that site and then waiting for the results

worm: malware that's primary objective is to replicate and spread. It can spread and function as a stand-alone entity, without intervention from a human or another program

Xmas attack: An advanced attack that tries to get around detection and send a packet with every single option enabled

zero-day exploit: An attack that begins the very day an exploit is discovered

zombie: Any system taking directions from a master controller computer
