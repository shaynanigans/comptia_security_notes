# ÃŸThe Present Threat Landscape:


- IoT threats
- Ransomware
- Medical Device hacking

Exploit Kits:
- REG EK
- Neutrino
- Magnitude
- Sundown
- Hunter

Basic Security Terms:
- Risk: The probability that a particular threat using a specific exploit will take advantage of a specific vulnerability
- Security Triad - CIA: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. Provide availibility and security of network resources
- Add defs for CIA
- Vulnerability: Weakness in a system or its design that can be exploited by a threat
    Examples:
    - Design Errors
    - Human Errors
    - Weakness in Protocol
    - Policy Flaws or lack of Policy
    - Software related
    - Malicious code
    - Servers
    - Misconfiguration
    - Lack of oversight
- Threat: Anything such as a human, object or substance that can act in a manner that can result in harm
- Threats are the agents/actors that exploit the vulnerability or weakness

Threats and Threat Agents
- APT
- Hostile Cyber Attacks
- Cognitive Threats
- Exploiting consumer electronics
- Interfering with critical infrastructure
- SCADA
- Interfering with programmable logic controllers at utilities, military etc.
- Natural disasters etc
- Zero day
- Threat agents are the persons, methods, techniques, operations, systems or entities that act or have the potential to act in a way to support a potential threat or exploit

Countermeasures and Mitigation:
- Need to make commercially reasonable actions
- Should be tailored to the organisation
- Types of Controls:
    - Administrative/Managerial: Policies and procedures
    - Technical: Electronics, Hardware and Software etc.: Sensors etc., Access cards
    - Physical: Mechanical and/or protect the physical infrastructure: Fences, locks etc
- Preventative (stop before it starts), Detective (find it), Corrective (mitigation), Recovery (getting back to normal) and Deterent (discourages violations)

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):
- Evidence of some action by a threat agent or threat actor
- Forensic evidence of an incursion or a disturbance
- AKA: Cyber observable
- Eg: Creation or updating of registry key values, unknown files types etc
