# Analysing Indicators of Compromise & Determining Malware Types

Module Overview:
- Ads, Spyware and Marketing
- Remote Access / Keyloggers
- Remote Attacks / DDoS


IOCs:
 - Indicator of Compromise (IOC): Artifacts observed that indicate (with a high degree of confidence) a system intrusion
 - Examples: 
    - Usual outbound network traffic - Someone trying to exfiltrate data
    - DNS request anomalies - port 53
    - Mismatch port-application traffic - If an application is using a weird/unusual port
    - Anomalies in privileged user account activity - Spike in unusual or attempted logins from privileged accounts

Common Vulnerabilities:
- Look at how to use MITRE website

Types of Malware:
Virus
- Malicious code that requires user interaction to install and replicate

Crypto-malware/Ransomware
- Malicious applications that scare or scam users into taking some kind of action

Worms
- Self-replication program that is usually self-contained and can execute and spread without user interaction (unlike viruses which require user interaction)
- Two main kinds:
    - Network Service Worms: Exploits network vulnerability to propagate and infect others
    - Mass Mailing Worms: Exploits email systems to spread and infect others

Trojan
- Friendly looking software that contains a hidden malicious software
- Masquerades as a legit program, typically installs a backdoor
- Examples include: Freeware/shareware, games or programs, system updates/patches (if not digitally signed)

Rootkit
- Malicious code that installs itself at the OS or Kernel level to avoid detection
- Load before OS loads
- Can disable anti-virus and anti-malware 
- Look at TDSSKiller by Kaspersky

Keylogger
- Malicious application that once installed on a host can capture all keystrokes

Adware
- Malware installed on an infected machine to deliver ads
- Tend to be installed in multiple places, within the Registry etc. which makes them harder to remove
- Look at MalwareBytes for anti-malware 

Spyware
- Malicious software that captures user activity and reports back 
- Used to install keyloggers and backdoors
- Works with other applications to gather user information and user data (PII or credit card data typical)

Stegomalware
- Hiding data/malware in an unexpected channel such as JPEG, PNG, YouTube video etc.

Botnets
- Malicious code that infects a large number of hosts for the purpose of launching large scale attacks on specific targets
- Attacker can be anywhere, have a Comand and Control server (C2, C&C) controlling thousands of bots/zombies

Logic Bomb
- Malicious code that triggers after a period of time based on some date or specific activity/event
- Hard to detect, can be lying in wait for a very long time
- Trigger examples include: mouse movement, file access, date/time, event/holiday, running a particular program, a piece of code executing a given no. of times etc.

Backdoors
- Software that installs for the purpose of opening ports and installing additional software
- Work in tandem with RATs
- Can be used to download and install no. of malicious tools
